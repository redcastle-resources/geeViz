"""LCMS API client — Landscape Change Monitoring System.

Wall-to-wall 30 m maps of land cover, land use, and change across the
conterminous US, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, currently spanning
1985-2025. Public, no authentication.

Three things about this API shape the client:

**It answers errors with HTTP 200.** An unknown summary area returns a
``ParameterError`` inside a 200 body, so a client checking ``.ok`` reads
failure as success and returns nothing. :mod:`geeViz.fsInsights._http`
inspects the payload; that check is the reason it exists.

**Trailing slashes matter.** ``/release`` 301-redirects while
``/release/`` returns data. Every path here carries its slash.

**Products carry their own palettes.** Each class comes back with a
``ClassValue`` and a ``ClassPalette``, which means visualization
parameters can be built *from the API* rather than from constants that
drift out of sync at every release. See :func:`lcms_vis_params`.

Areas are precomputed — 3,643 of them (counties, ranger districts, plus
CONUS and All-Lands rollups). There is no runtime zonal-statistics
engine behind this API: ``bbox``, ``geojson`` and ``geometry`` are all
rejected, and ``POST`` returns 403. For an arbitrary polygon, use the
Earth Engine copies of the same products, which is what
:func:`lcms_summary` does when handed a geometry.
