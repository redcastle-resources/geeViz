"""One shape for "this call spent LLM tokens", and one place to report it.

Three geeViz modules call Gemini directly — :mod:`geeViz.googleMapsLib`,
:mod:`geeViz.inventoryLib` and :mod:`geeViz.outputLib.reports`. Two of
them already pulled token counts off the response and returned them in a
``metadata`` dict; the third threw them away. All three used different
key names, and none of the counts reached anything that accounts for
spend, so tokens burned through the geeViz libraries were invisible to
the agent that paid for them.

This module fixes the shape and the reporting separately:

**The shape** — :func:`usage_from_response` turns a ``google-genai``
response into a dict whose keys match what the consumer already speaks
(``prompt_tokens``, ``candidates_tokens``, ``thoughts_tokens``,
``cached_tokens``, ``tool_use_prompt_tokens``, ``total_tokens``). The old
geeViz spellings — ``input_tokens``, ``output_tokens``,
``thought_tokens`` — were a second vocabulary for the same numbers, and
every hand-off between the two was a chance to drop a field silently.

**The reporting** — :func:`report` hands the record to
:data:`on_usage`, a hook that does nothing by default. geeViz is a
standalone library: it must not import an agent, hold database
credentials, or know who is being billed. A host that cares (the MCP
server, which runs as a subprocess of the agent) sets the hook at
startup and forwards what it collects.

Nothing here can raise into a caller. A failure to *account* for work
must never fail the work.

Example — a host collecting what one call spent::

    import geeViz.llmUsage as lu

    with lu.collect() as records:
        result = some_geeviz_function_that_calls_gemini()
    # records is a list of usage dicts, one per Gemini response

    recognized as a repeat.

    call really did cost money twice and should be counted twice. What
    it protects against is the same record being submitted twice: a tool
    result replayed out of conversation history, a delivery retried, a
    collector drained twice. Those must not bill anybody a second time.

    So: use Gemini's id when there is one, mint a ``geeviz-`` prefixed
