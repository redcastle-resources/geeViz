/**
 * Animated wind particles for geeViz, in the style of windy.com.
 *
 * Two layers make the picture, and the raster is the louder one: a
 * smooth speed field underneath (an ordinary geeViz image layer,
 * bicubic-resampled and queryable) with thin fading trails over the
 * top. This file draws only the trails.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * From the TILES, decoded. Earth Engine renders u and v into the red and
 * green channels of ordinary PNG map tiles, linearly stretched from
 * WIND_TILE_MIN/MAX m/s onto 0..255 (see geeViz.weather.windTiles). The
 * client fetches the tiles it is looking at, reads their pixels through
 * an offscreen canvas, and inverts the stretch.
 *
 * The stretch is HARD-CODED here and in Python, deliberately. It is the
 * one number both sides must agree on, and a mismatch does not throw --
 * it yields wrong-but-plausible winds, which look like weather rather
 * than like a bug.
 *
 * The predecessor shipped a JSON lattice sampled once over a fixed
 * region. It worked, but panning past the edge of that region simply
 * stopped the animation, and a continent's worth of lattice was ~200 KB
 * on the wire. Tiles stream with the view instead: pan anywhere, at any
 * zoom, and the data follows.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ATTACHMENT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The encoded image is added as a normal geeImage layer, so the viewer
 * mints its tile URL and builds a real layer-list entry (checkbox,
 * opacity). This file then takes the layer OFF the map -- the raw RGB is
 * nonsense to look at -- and keeps its `getTileUrl` to fetch tiles
 * numerically.
 *
 * `layerObj` is declared as a top-level `let`, so it lives in the global
 * LEXICAL environment and is NOT a property of `window`; a bare
 * reference resolves it while `window.layerObj` is undefined.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * COST
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A real animation loop, so it must not run unseen: it stops when the
 * layer is unchecked and when the page is hidden. An invisible rAF loop
 * draining a battery is how this kind of layer becomes a regret.
