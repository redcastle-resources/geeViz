"""``getForecastData`` is about forecast data, not only about wind.

``variable`` picks what comes back: ``"wind"`` (u/v), a VARIABLES key or
list of them (renamed and unit-normalised), or ``None`` for every band
as published.

The point of the VARIABLES table is that three products spelling the
same quantity three ways -- and two of them publishing Kelvin -- become
one name and one unit. These hit the live collections and skip offline.
