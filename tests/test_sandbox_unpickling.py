"""Unpickling is arbitrary code execution, and the sandbox hands out a
file-write primitive.

Found while auditing whether scipy / scikit-learn / statsmodels could be
added safely. They can — but the audit turned up an escape that needed
NONE of them, using only what the sandbox already provides:

    save_file('x.pkl', <bytes whose __reduce__ calls anything>)
    pd.read_pickle(path)              -> attacker code ran
    np.load(path, allow_pickle=True)  -> attacker code ran

Both halves are legitimate in isolation. ``save_file`` exists so the
agent can hand the user a GIF or a report; pandas and numpy are the
point of the REPL. The ``pickle`` MODULE was already blocked, which is
what made this look covered — the hole is that several available
libraries will unpickle on your behalf from a trusted stack frame, so
neither the import blocklist nor the audit hook ever sees it.

Blocking the READ side is the narrow fix. Nothing in a geospatial
analysis needs to unpickle a file the same session just wrote.

# urllib.request` were both refused while

#
# returned status 200 with 559 bytes. The blocklist matched on the
# TOP-LEVEL module name, and "urllib3" != "urllib", so blocking the
# friendly wrappers left the transport they sit on wide open. httpx,
# aiohttp, httplib2 and websocket were equally importable — all present
# as transitive dependencies nobody chose.
#
# Writing its own package: NO. save_file reduces the name with
# os.path.basename so it cannot traverse, the output directory is not on
# sys.path, and `sys` is blocked so it cannot be put there. Verified:
# `import evilmod` -> ModuleNotFoundError, and the sys.path workaround

# gv.os and cl.os are all the real os module. The import blocklist only

#   cl.os.listdir(.) -> real directory listing
#   gil.os.getcwd()  -> real path

# watches that one SYSCALL. Reading os.environ raises no audit event, so
# nothing fired.

# ee.Image.select (the most used call in the codebase), `signal` is
# scipy.signal, `code` is a plausible response field. Blocking those
