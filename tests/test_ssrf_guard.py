"""Library HTTP helpers must not reach the cloud metadata service.

Found while evaluating a checklist that named 169.254.169.254 as a
must-block. Checking whether that applied here turned up a live SSRF
that the MCP import blocklist could not see:

    from geeViz import esriLib
    esriLib.getServiceMetadata('http://example.com')

``getServiceMetadata`` is PUBLIC and takes a URL. It runs in a geeViz
frame, and _called_from_trusted_lib trusts the geeViz tree, so the
sandbox's HTTP-library block never applies. Verified with urllib3 fully
blocked: that call fetched example.com and returned the response body
inside the exception message — outbound HTTP *and* read-back, from a
sandbox that supposedly had neither.

On Cloud Run the payoff is concrete: 169.254.169.254 hands the runtime
service account's OAuth token to anything that can make a local HTTP
request.

This guard is not a boundary. It closes loopback / private / link-local
and the file:// scheme. Any public host is still reachable, which is what
network egress control is for — the guard removes the cheap credential
grab, it does not replace the network policy.
