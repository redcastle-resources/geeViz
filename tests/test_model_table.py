"""The documented model facts, checked against the live collections.

``weather.py``'s module docstring carries a table of resolution, archive
start, initialization cadence, horizon and lead step. A table like that
is a set of claims about four feeds nobody here controls, and the
failure mode is not an exception -- it is a user planning a five-day
request against a run that stops in two.

So the numbers live in ``MODELS`` as data, the docstring quotes them,
and this module checks both: the data against Earth Engine, and the
docstring against the data.

The horizon split is the one that matters most. WeatherNext interleaves
6-hourly inits reaching 360 hours with twenty interim hourly inits that
stop at 48, and ECMWF does the same at 360/144. "The most recent run" is
therefore usually one that cannot cover a forward window.
