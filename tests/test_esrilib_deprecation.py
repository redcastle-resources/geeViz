"""esriLib is deprecated and delegates to georest.

georest is the maintained implementation of everything in this module
that talks to an Esri REST endpoint — same function names, compatible
signatures, and stdlib-only, so depending on it costs an install
nothing. It also does considerably more than esriLib ever did.

What this file guards is the part that is easy to get wrong: delegating
must not quietly change what callers see. A deprecated module people
already depend on has to keep raising what it documented, keep its
signatures, and say once — not per call — that it has moved.
