"""``getForecastData`` hides how each model marks run and valid time.

That is the whole point of the function. Three products, three
conventions:

======================  =========================  ====================
model                   run (initialization)       valid time
======================  =========================  ====================
gfs   NOAA/GFS0P25      ``creation_time`` (ms)     ``forecast_time``
euro  ECMWF IFS         ``creation_time`` (ms)     ``forecast_time``
wn    WeatherNext 3     ``start_time`` (ISO str)   ``end_time`` (ISO)
======================  =========================  ====================

Per the WeatherNext schema
(https://developers.google.com/weathernext/guides/earth-engine):
``start_time`` is "the initialization time of the forecast" and
``end_time`` is "the valid time for this specific forecast. Calculated
as start_time + forecast_hour."

Two things make this worth pinning rather than trusting:

* **Earth Engine filters do not coerce types.** Comparing a string
  property against a number returns an EMPTY collection instead of
  raising, so getting it wrong reads as "no data for that window", not
  as a bug. (``ee.Filter.Or`` of both forms does not rescue it — that
  raises ``Cannot compare values ... Type<String> ... Type<Float>``.)
* **WeatherNext's ``system:time_start`` is the INIT time**, one value
  for every image in a run, despite the schema table describing it as
  the valid time. Anything selecting on it picks a run rather than a
  moment. ``getForecastData`` restamps it to the valid time on output so
  time lapses and charts order correctly.

These hit the live collections. They skip rather than fail where Earth
Engine is not reachable, so the suite still runs offline.
