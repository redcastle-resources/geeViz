"""Shipped viewer assets must bust cache on upgrade.

geeViz cache-busts the PAGE (``geeView/?v=<timestamp>``) but that does
nothing for its sub-resources. Found the hard way: a fix to
``wind-particles.js`` did not take effect until a hard reload, and the
stale copy failed silently — the wind arrows fell through to the
viewer's default point style and rendered as dots, with no error.

Two different problems, two different answers:

* **shipped assets** change only on upgrade, so they carry
  ``?v=<geeViz version>``. Defeating caching for them would make every
  page load re-download the bundle.
* **``runGeeViz.js``** is rewritten by every ``Map.view()`` call — it is
  the layer list. It gets ``no-store`` from the request handler; a
  version stamp would be exactly wrong.
