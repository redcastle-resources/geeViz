"""Fuels and terrain assembly — the layer everything else stands on.

The bottleneck in real fire work is almost never the simulator. It is
assembling fuels, terrain, and weather into one consistent, aligned
stack, then redoing all of it when a boundary or a year changes. That is
exactly what Earth Engine removes, and it is why this module exists
before any behavior model does.

Asset ids below were verified against the live catalog. LANDFIRE lives
in the community catalog (``projects/sat-io/...``) rather than the
official one, which is easy to guess wrong.

Fuel-model note: ``FBFM40`` (Scott & Burgan) and ``FBFM13`` (Anderson)
are *classification* rasters — each pixel carries a fuel model number,
and the physical parameters that number implies (fuel load by size
class, surface-area-to-volume ratio, bed depth, moisture of extinction)
live in a lookup table, not in the raster. :func:`fuel_model_params`
holds that table for the subset needed by a Rothermel spread
calculation.

# often encountered, in the units Rothermel's equations expect:
