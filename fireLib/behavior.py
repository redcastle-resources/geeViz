"""Per-pixel fire behavior — Rothermel surface spread and its consequences.

This is the part of fire modeling Earth Engine is genuinely *ideal* for.
Rothermel's rate of spread given a fuel bed, slope, wind and moisture is
a pure pixel-wise function: no neighbors, no iteration, no state. It maps
onto a tile-parallel engine perfectly, at CONUS scale, across as many
weather scenarios as you care to run.

The model (Rothermel 1972, INT-115) computes

    R = (I_R * xi * (1 + phi_w + phi_s)) / (rho_b * eps * Q_ig)

where ``I_R`` is reaction intensity, ``xi`` the propagating flux ratio,
``phi_w`` and ``phi_s`` the wind and slope factors, and the denominator
the heat sink. Everything here is in Rothermel's original English units
(tons/acre, ft, ft/min, BTU/lb) because the published coefficients are,
and converting the coefficients rather than the inputs is how sign and
magnitude errors get in. Conversion to metric happens once, at the edge,
in :func:`ros_metric`.

**On accuracy.** This is the surface-fire model. It does not include
crown fire (see :func:`crown_fire_initiation`), spotting, or any
fire-atmosphere coupling. Rothermel himself scoped it to a quasi-steady
fire spreading through continuous, uniform surface fuel — real fires
routinely violate every one of those. Treat the output as a physically
grounded index that is well correlated with observed spread, not as a
prediction of what a specific fire will do.
